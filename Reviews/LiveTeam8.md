**40187433 - Ana Rostam - Team: AVM Query**

**Team #8 (The Costco guys), project title: Weather Transit**

**Overall Presentation: A+**

The presentation provided detailed information regarding the project and its implementation. They demonstrated their work and gave some examples, such as the queries they have done. Overall, they gave the audience a good understanding of their work. 

**Complexity/Applicability of the database application: A**

The structure and the design of their database look good. However, it would be more helpful to the audience if they provided a better-designed ERD. The ERD they provided is the one from pgAdmin, which can be complicated for the viewer to understand, since some of the connections cannot be shown on the picture (they are cut off). In the design and based on what they explained, they placed the weak entity appropriately. 
During the migration, they changed the structure of their design in the NoSQL database, but they didn’t provide any information on what they changed and how they did it.
Overall, the design was good but hard to understand.


**Use of technology: A+**

The team used PostgreSQL as a relational database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. These choices, along well the scope of the project and provide a flexible and manageable access to the data based on the project’s requirements.

**The presentation addresses all challenges: A+**

They mentioned the challenges they faced during both phases. The challenges they mentioned were API rate limit, foreign key links, and the consistency regarding migration of data. They also provided some explanation of how they managed to overcome these challenges, which helped the audience to learn from them.

**Teamwork and participation: A+**

During the presentation, the team showed a good and fair distribution of work. They did not explicitly mention how they split the work during implementation. Overall, they all participated, which showed good participation among them.


**Additional comment/suggestion:**

For further improvement, the team can add another ERD of their project structure, one that is clearer and gives a visual understanding to the viewer of the presentation.
